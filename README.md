# code-refactor-horiseon

This is a refactoring assignment in which I was provided a code to refactor with HTML semantics while still enabling the site to remain the way it was intended to be; presentation and all. By working through this assignment I educated myself in using HTML semantics while also modifying the CSS to match said semantics. Exploring how the CSS works in tangent with the HTML, discovering new ways to reclassify and format things, consolidating certain code to remove redundancy, breaking the code and figuring out why and what went wrong.
